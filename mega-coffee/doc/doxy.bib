    abstract = {{The generalized Lloyd algorithm plays an important role in the
design of vector quantizers (VQ) and in feature clustering for pattern
recognition. In the VQ context, this algorithm provides a procedure to
iteratively improve a codebook and results in a local minimum that
minimizes the average distortion function. We propose an efficient
method to obtain a good initial codebook that can accelerate the
convergence of the generalized Lloyd algorithm and achieve a better
local minimum as well}},
