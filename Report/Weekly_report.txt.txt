During the week we work trying to implement a tree and the operations to go across it in the way we want.
We tried with 2 different sets. (depth 4 & 5). where we had some problems at the time to define the functionality and how the algorithm will work during the limit cases.

//Weekly report 02		3/09 - 3/16

We start the week with the same problems of the end of the first week. We still need a meeting all together and not just explain a dummy example.
It's hard to code when you only have 2 examples and you don't see how the follow a pattern.
